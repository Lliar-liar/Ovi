        "prompt": "A cinematic slow-motion shot shows a golfer fully in frame from the side inside a sand trap on a sunny morning. The golfer takes a focused stance, swings down, and the club strikes the sand inches behind the ball with a dull thump, blasting a cloud of beige grains that rushes upward with a soft hiss. The ball rides out on the sand splash and lands on the green while sand rains down with faint pattering, and the golfer holds the follow-through pose, watching the shot."

        "prompt": "A low-angle wide shot captures the entire motocross rider and bike approaching a muddy ramp at speed, the engine snarling and rising in pitch. The rider launches into the air and whips the bike sideways mid-flight, body twisted and knees gripping the frame as clods of dirt rattle off the tires. As the rider straightens out, wind roar dominates for a beat, then the landing hits with a heavy slap of tires on wet ground and a deep suspension clunk as the rider continues down the track."
