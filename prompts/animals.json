    "content": "Dog Shake-Off After Bath",
    "prompt": "In a bright bathroom, a wet golden retriever stands in a tub as a human turns off the faucet with a click and water drips steadily from the dog’s fur into the porcelain. The dog pauses, then shakes violently from head to tail, sending droplets splattering against the tile with rapid pattering sounds, while the human laughs and says, \"Okay, okay—shake it out,\" as the dog’s collar tag jingles with each snap of the body."

  {
    "content": "Cat Kneading on a Blanket",
    "prompt": "A cozy living-room close-up shows a cat climbing onto a thick knitted blanket and starting to knead with alternating paws. Each press compresses the fabric with faint soft thumps and tiny claw snags, and the cat purrs steadily as its shoulders rock in rhythm. A human hand briefly pets the cat’s head, and the cat’s purr grows louder while the blanket fibers shift under the paws."

  {
    "content": "Dog Fetch on Gravel Path",
    "prompt": "A handheld outdoor shot shows a person tossing a tennis ball down a gravel path with a quick whoosh. A dog sprints after it, nails clicking rapidly on stones and gravel crunching underfoot, then the dog skids to a stop with a gritty scrape and clamps the ball with a squeaky bite. As the dog runs back, the collar jingles and the person calls, \"Bring it here!\" while the dog drops the ball at their feet with a soft plop."

  {
    "content": "Cat vs. Laser Pointer",
    "prompt": "A low-angle indoor shot shows a red laser dot darting across a wooden floor as a cat’s head tracks it silently. The dot stops abruptly; the cat pounces with a quick thud and claws scraping the wood, then slides slightly with a squeaky skid. The laser dot shoots away again and the cat’s rapid paw taps follow, while a human off-camera says, \"Ready… go!\" each time the dot changes direction."

  {
    "content": "Puppy Chewing a Squeaky Toy",
    "prompt": "A close-up on a small puppy holding a rubber squeaky toy between its front paws on a carpet. The puppy bites down repeatedly, and each jaw squeeze triggers a sharp squeak exactly as the toy visibly compresses and rebounds. The puppy pauses to reposition the toy with little snuffles, then resumes chewing faster, making a mix of squeaks and wet mouth sounds while the human says, \"That’s your favorite one, huh?\""
  },
  {
    "content": "Parrot Mimics a Phone Notification",
    "prompt": "In a kitchen with faint appliance hum, a colorful parrot sits on a perch next to a phone. The phone plays a short notification chime, and the parrot immediately imitates it with a clear high-pitched whistle. The owner taps the perch lightly and says, \"Do it again,\" and the parrot repeats the same rhythm, bobbing its head in sync with the whistled notes."

  {
    "content": "Horse Hooves on Stable Floor",
    "prompt": "A stable corridor shot shows a horse being led by a handler; the lead rope hardware clinks softly as the horse walks. Each hoof lands with a solid clop on packed dirt, then changes to a sharper ring as the horse steps onto a concrete section. The handler says, \"Easy,\" as the horse snorts and exhales, and the camera catches the shift in footstep sound with the change in surface."
  },
  {
    "content": "Goat Eats Crunchy Leaves",
    "prompt": "A farmyard close-up shows a goat grabbing a leafy branch from a human hand. The goat’s teeth tear leaves off with loud crunchy snaps, and its jaw chews in a steady rhythm while the branch rustles and bends.

  {
    "content": "Rabbit Thumps and Freezes",
    "prompt": "A quiet garden shot shows a rabbit nibbling grass with tiny quick bites that make faint crunching sounds. A sudden distant noise makes the rabbit freeze, ears upright, then it thumps one hind foot sharply on the ground with a dull thud. After a brief still moment, it darts away through dry leaves that crackle rapidly as it disappears."

  {
    "content": "Squirrel Cracks a Nut on a Branch",
    "prompt": "A telephoto shot of a squirrel perched on a tree branch in a park with soft wind and distant birds. The squirrel holds a nut between its paws and gnaws; the shell cracks with small sharp snaps, and flakes fall onto leaves below with faint patters. The squirrel pauses to look around, tail flicking with a soft brush sound, then resumes cracking and eating."
  },
  {
    "content": "Woodpecker Drumming",
    "prompt": "A forest shot frames a woodpecker clinging to a tree trunk. The bird suddenly starts drumming, its beak striking the bark in a rapid staccato that sounds like a fast wooden tapping roll. Each burst matches the visible head vibration, and after a short pause the bird calls once, then drums again as bark chips fall."
  },
  {
    "content": "Frog Chorus at Dusk",
    "prompt": "A wide shot of a wetland at dusk shows still water with reeds swaying. As the camera pans slowly, a chorus of frogs fills the scene with overlapping croaks that rise and fall in waves. A single frog near the camera inflates its throat sac visibly with each call, and its louder croaks land exactly with the pulsing throat movement."

  {
    "content": "Cicadas in Summer Heat",
    "prompt": "A static shot of sunlit trees in a hot summer park shows leaves barely moving. The audio is dominated by a dense, continuous cicada buzz that swells and dips slightly as the camera tilts toward different branches.

  {
    "content": "Owl Silent Flight and Landing",
    "prompt": "A night-time woodland shot with faint wind and distant insects shows an owl gliding across frame almost silently. The owl lands on a wooden fence post, and the only sound is a soft feathered whoosh and a tiny claw scrape as it grips the wood.

  },
  {
    "content": "Wolves Howling Response",
    "prompt": "A wide twilight shot of a rocky ridge shows a pack of wolves standing still in silhouette. One wolf lifts its head and begins a long howl that carries across the open landscape, and a second and third wolf join in, their voices stacking and overlapping. The camera captures their chest expansion and muzzle angle aligning with the sustained howls before they fall quiet again."

  {
    "content": "Whale Blow at the Surface",
    "prompt": "A boat-level ocean shot shows calm swells and distant seabirds. A whale surfaces near the camera, and its blowhole releases a sudden explosive breath with a powerful wet exhale sound and misty spray. The whale’s back rolls past with water sheeting off in a rushing cascade, then it slips under the surface as the ocean returns to gentle wave sounds."
  },
  {
    "content": "Dolphins Breach and Splash",
    "prompt": "A sunny sea shot shows two dolphins swimming fast, their dorsal fins cutting the surface with small splashes. One dolphin bursts out of the water in a clean arc, landing with a loud slap and spray, and a second follows a moment later with another splash.

  {
    "content": "Penguins Sliding on Ice (Colony Ambience)",
    "prompt": "A wide shot of a penguin colony on a windy icy shoreline captures constant background calls and the low roar of wind. A penguin belly-slides across packed snow, making a soft scraping sound, then pops up to waddle with quick foot taps. Nearby penguins squawk and flap, and a chick peeps sharply while the sliding penguin shakes snow off with a faint rustle."
  },
  {
    "content": "Elephants Dust Bath",
    "prompt": "A savanna shot shows an elephant scooping dry earth with its trunk, the grains cascading with a dry sandy pour. The elephant blasts the dust over its back with a forceful trunk exhale, making a deep whoof as dust clouds billow. The elephant’s ears flap with heavy leathery slaps, and it rumbles softly while taking a slow step that thuds into the ground."
  },
  {
    "content": "Snake Slithers Through Dry Leaves",
    "prompt": "A ground-level shot in a forest shows a snake moving smoothly through a bed of dry leaves. As its body pushes forward, the leaves crackle and rustle in a continuous whispery trail exactly where the scales pass. The snake pauses, tongue flicking silently, then resumes slithering as a twig snaps lightly under its weight."
