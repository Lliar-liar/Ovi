    "content": "Iodine Clock Reaction",
    "prompt": "A close-up lab demo on a white table with quiet room tone. A clear beaker contains an acidic hydrogen peroxide mixture, and a second cup contains a clear solution of potassium iodide mixed with sodium thiosulfate and starch indicator. A narrator explains reaction kinetics as the hand pours the iodide mixture into the peroxide with a soft glug and begins swirling; the liquid stays seemingly unchanged for a few seconds, then suddenly the entire beaker undergoes an instantaneous uniform color change all at once while the swirling continues."

  {
    "content": "Elephant's Toothpaste",
    "prompt": "A wide outdoor science experiment with natural ambience and excited chatter. A demonstrator in goggles shows a large flask containing concentrated hydrogen peroxide mixed with dish soap and food coloring, then quickly pours in a small cup of potassium iodide catalyst solution with a loud slosh against glass. After a brief beat, thick foam erupts upward and out, growing rapidly as a loud wet hiss and fizzing bubbling sound builds; the demonstrator laughs and says, \"Stand back—here it comes!\" as the foam spills over the rim and patters onto the tray."

  {
    "content": "Silver Mirror Reaction (Tollens' Test)",
    "prompt": "A cinematic close-up in a quiet lab shows a round-bottom flask containing freshly prepared Tollens’ reagent (ammoniacal silver nitrate solution). A small amount of glucose solution is added with a gentle pour, then the flask is swirled so the liquid climbs the glass walls with a soft sloshing sound. Over time, the inner surface of the flask undergoes a visible change, gradually forming a reflective coating that spreads as the swirling continues."

  {
    "content": "Golden Rain Reaction (Lead Iodide Precipitate)",
    "prompt": "A macro close-up against a dark background with faint room ambience. One beaker holds a clear aqueous lead nitrate solution and another holds a clear potassium iodide solution. The demonstrator pours the potassium iodide into the lead nitrate with a clean glug-glug sound and stirs with a glass rod that clinks lightly against the beaker; immediately a dense precipitate forms throughout the liquid, making the mixture turn cloudy as countless fine particles swirl like glitter and then slowly drift downward and collect at the bottom."
  },
  {
    "content": "Sodium in Water",
    "prompt": "A realistic lab-style shot of a glass tank half-filled with water, with faint room ambience. Using tongs, a small piece of sodium metal is dropped onto the surface with a tiny plunk, and it immediately skates and darts across the water, producing urgent crackling hisses and leaving a visible trail. The reaction intensifies within moments, culminating in a sudden energetic burst at the surface with a loud pop and spray that splashes against the tank walls."

  {
    "content": "Pharaoh's Serpent",
    "prompt": "A time-lapse tabletop shot on a heat-resistant tile in a quiet room. A small pellet of mercury(II) thiocyanate sits in the center; a flame touches it with a soft crackle, and as it burns a dry, ashy rustle continues. The video captures a long porous snake-like structure swelling and curling upward from the ash, continuously growing and branching as the crackling burn persists underneath."
  },
  {
    "content": "Luminol Reaction",
    "prompt": "A video in a completely dark room where only the apparatus is visible. A narrator whispers, \"Watch the light,\" as two liquids—luminol solution and an oxidizer solution containing hydrogen peroxide with a catalyst—are poured simultaneously into a spiral glass tube, the streams making an audible trickling sound. As the liquids meet and flow, a self-generated glow appears inside the tubing and travels with the moving fluid, brightening and fading along the path while the trickling continues."

  {
    "content": "Briggs-Rauscher Reaction (Oscillating Clock)",
    "prompt": "A high-speed time-lapse shows a beaker on a magnetic stirrer, the stir plate motor making a steady whir as a stir bar spins. The beaker contains a Briggs–Rauscher mixture (hydrogen peroxide, potassium iodate, malonic acid, and a metal-ion catalyst with starch indicator). While the vortex turns, the liquid repeatedly cycles through several distinct visible states in a rhythmic pattern, switching abruptly and then returning again and again as the stirring continues."
  },
  {
    "content": "Dehydration of Sugar (Sulfuric Acid)",
    "prompt": "A close-up lab observation with no music. A beaker of white granulated sugar sits on the bench, and a clear, viscous concentrated sulfuric acid is poured in with a thick glug and sticky drip. The mixture immediately crackles and bubbles audibly as it heats up, rapidly darkening and expanding into a rigid porous column that rises out of the beaker while hot vapor vents with a wet hiss."
  },
  {
    "content": "Supercooling of Water (Instant Ice)",
    "prompt": "A handheld shot of a bottle of purified water taken from a freezer, with faint room ambience. A voice counts, \"Three, two, one,\" and the bottle is firmly tapped on a table with a solid thud; right after the impact, crystallization begins at the contact point and spreads through the bottle in a fast-moving front, accompanied by faint crackling ice sounds as the once-clear liquid turns opaque."
  },
  {
    "content": "Thermite Reaction",
    "prompt": "A wide safety-distance outdoor shot in a sand pit with faint wind noise. A clay pot contains a thermite mixture of iron(III) oxide powder and aluminum powder; a magnesium ribbon fuse is lit on top, sputtering with sharp crackles. When the fuse reaches the mixture, the reaction erupts into an extremely intense light and a roaring spray of sparks, and moments later molten material drips and sizzles into the sand with heavy sizzling spits."
  },
  {
    "content": "Sodium Acetate Crystallization ('Hot Ice')",
    "prompt": "A close-up tabletop shot in quiet room tone. A hand slowly pours a clear supersaturated sodium acetate solution from a beaker onto a watch glass containing a tiny seed crystal, the liquid making a gentle pour sound. The instant the stream touches the seed point, the liquid turns solid at the contact and a crystal structure rapidly grows outward and upward, building a rising tower as the pouring continues."

  {
    "content": "Dry Ice Sublimation in Water",
    "prompt": "A tabletop demo in a quiet room. Metal tongs clink as they drop chunks of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) into a beaker of warm water with a plop, and immediately thick fog billows over the rim while the water erupts into vigorous bubbling. A loud, continuous fizzing and rumbling gurgle accompanies the rolling vapor as it spills down the sides."
  },
  {
    "content": "Ferrofluid and Magnet",
    "prompt": "A macro shot of a petri dish filled with glossy black ferrofluid in near silence. A strong neodymium magnet slides beneath the dish with a faint scrape on the table, and the liquid responds instantly by rising into sharp spikes that form a shifting geometric pattern. As the magnet moves, the spikes lean, merge, and rearrange in sync with the unseen pull."

  {
    "content": "Belousov-Zhabotinsky Reaction",
    "prompt": "A top-down time-lapse of a petri dish containing a Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction mixture (acidic solution with bromate, an organic acid, and a metal-ion indicator catalyst). With faint room ambience, the initially uniform liquid begins to generate organized traveling wave patterns, forming expanding rings and spirals that propagate and collide across the dish while the surface remains otherwise still."
  },
  {
    "content": "Chemical Garden",
    "prompt": "A time-lapse shot of a beaker filled with clear sodium silicate solution in a quiet room. Small crystals of metal salts (such as copper sulfate or cobalt chloride) are dropped in with soft plinks against glass, and over time they sprout upward into hollow tubular structures that branch and curl like plants. Tiny bubbles appear around the bases with faint fizzing, and wispy colored plumes drift in the liquid as the structures grow."

  {
    "content": "Potassium Permanganate and Glycerin",
    "prompt": "A static close-up of a small pile of potassium permanganate crystals on a ceramic tile, with quiet room tone. A narrator says, \"Wait for it…\" as a few drops of glycerin are dripped onto the center with slow sticky plops. Nothing happens for a short delay, then smoke begins to vent with a soft hiss and quickly intensifies into a sudden ignition with a sharp whoosh and vigorous crackling burn."
  },
  {
    "content": "Hydrophobic Sand ('Magic Sand')",
    "prompt": "A hands-on demo beside a clear water tank with audible splashes. A hand pours brightly colored hydrophobic sand into the water, and it sinks in clumps and columns instead of dispersing, landing with muted underwater thuds. A spoon scoops the sand up and when it breaks the surface with a wet slosh, the grains instantly appear dry and loose, pouring off the spoon with a crisp dry rattle rather than sticking together."
  },
  {
    "content": "Burning Magnesium Ribbon",
    "prompt": "A darkened lab shot with the steady hiss of a gas burner. Tongs hold a thin magnesium ribbon that catches with a sharp crackling sputter, and the moment it ignites it produces an extremely intense bright light that floods the room while the ribbon sizzles and spits. As it finishes, a fragile powdery residue remains and flakes off with a soft crumble when the tongs move."
  },
  {
    "content": "Traffic Light Reaction (Chemical Chameleon)",
    "prompt": "A continuous shot of a sealed flask on a table with faint room ambience. The flask contains a chemical chameleon mixture (a glucose solution in sodium hydroxide with an indicator dye), and it is shaken vigorously so the liquid sloshes loudly against glass and fills with bubbles. Each time the shaking stops and the flask is set down, the liquid slowly transitions through a sequence of distinct visible states on its own, then resets when it is shaken again, repeating the cycle several times while a voice says, \"Shake… and watch.\""
